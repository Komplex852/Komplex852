    <h1>Juan K.</h1>
    <h2>Passionate Programmer | Aspiring Developer</h2>

    <p>Welcome to my profile! I'm <strong>Juan K.</strong>, a 24-year-old programming enthusiast with a thirst for knowledge and a drive to excel in the world of software development.</p>

    <p>With a solid foundation in <strong>Python</strong> and a growing understanding of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>, I'm constantly honing my skills to become a well-rounded developer. While my experience may be considered basic, I am dedicated to expanding my horizons and taking on exciting challenges.</p>

    <p>My focus lies in web development and statistical applications, as I'm fascinated by their potential to transform ideas into tangible solutions. Although I'm yet to showcase completed projects, I'm eager to apply my knowledge and bring innovative concepts to life.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am proficient in utilizing tools such as <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>Github</strong>, and <strong>Visual Studio Code (VSC)</strong>, enabling me to develop and collaborate efficiently. I'm also eager to explore security, desktop application development, and virtualization, areas that captivate my curiosity and spark my creativity.</p>
    </div>

    <p>While I haven't had the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects or collaborate on public repositories, I'm open to collaboration and always ready to learn. If you're interested in working together or have any questions, please feel free to reach out.</p>

    <p>Though I haven't yet delved into methodologies like <strong>Scrum</strong> or <strong>Kanban</strong> or extensively practiced version control, I'm enthusiastic about adopting agile methodologies and leveraging version control tools like <strong>Git</strong> in future projects. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I'm ready to embrace new practices that enhance productivity and teamwork.</p>

    <p>While I haven't participated in hackathons or programming competitions, I look forward to engaging in these events to challenge myself and refine my skills in intense development environments.</p>
